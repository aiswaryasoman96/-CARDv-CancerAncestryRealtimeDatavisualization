5. The 17 circular graphs show the importance of this gene towards cancer with respect to each ancestry.
6. From the drop down menu below the overview bar graph, you can choose (one or more, upto 5) the ancestries in which you want to explore the SNP mutations details.
7. This renders the bar graph representation of the mutation frequency of the selected gene in that selected ancestry – This is divided into 4 categories – LOW,MODERATE,MODIFIER,HIGH
8. Hover over the purple bars to see the exact frequency of that mutation in that particular category.
